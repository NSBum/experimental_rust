# rustripregex

This is a little project that illustrates a couple concepts:

- [Named capture groups](https://www.regular-expressions.info/named.html)
- [Use of the regex crate](https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/#)
- the `replace_all` function of Regex

The idea is simply to strip the combining diacritical marks from vowels in Russian text.
